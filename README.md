## Folders
Each of the folders contain the different coding parts of each section. 
- Bootcamp
  * This folder contains the good for the bootcamp before the Pre-College program started. This contains the fundamentsl to GO along with specific topics
    1. Monte Carlo
    2. Metagenomics (Diversity measurments)
    3. Game of Life
- Hackathons
  * This folder is specific for the hackathon projects (listed above in sections)
- Fun
  * This folder is for the fun (extra information/code along) an any coding for the lab specifically.
- Lectures
  * This folder contains code/pdfs from lecturers that came to CMU
